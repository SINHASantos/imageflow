### More details 

* Imageflow is dual licensed under a commercial license and the AGPLv3.
* Imageflow.NET is tri-licensed under a commercial license, the AGPLv3, and the Apache 2 license.
* Imageflow Server is dual licensed under a commercial license and the AGPLv3.
* We offer commercial licenses at https://imageresizing.net/pricing
* Imageflow.NET's Apache 2 license allows for integration with non-copyleft products, as long as jobs are not actually executed (since the AGPLv3/commercial license is needed when libimageflow is linked at runtime). This can allow end-users to benefit from optional imageflow integration in products.
