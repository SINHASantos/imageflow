The structs and enums from @/imageflow_types/src/lib.rs are used in every rust file - always load it!, and also serve as the JSON API schema. 

Those structs are also used in all the endpoints, see @/imageflow_core/src/context_method.rs 

The JSON API is partially documented in /docs/src/json/, so when modifying or working on imageflow_types, load the whole /docs/src/json/ folder and help keep the docs, code examples, and structs synced.
