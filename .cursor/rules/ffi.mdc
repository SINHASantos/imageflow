Imageflow offers a very stable ABI, focused on sending/recieving JSON and byte buffers in conjuction with an endpoint string. There are wrappers in C# (the main one), go, node, elixr, and more. Keeping these wrappers up-to-date with the latest JSON features is difficult, and the nature of the JSON graph structure makes it require simpler API wrappers. 

For the HTTP-like endpoint names, see @/imageflow_core/src/context_method.rs 

For the FFI ABI, read @/imageflow_abi/src/lib.rs and [imageflow_default.h](mdc:bindings/headers/imageflow_default.h)
